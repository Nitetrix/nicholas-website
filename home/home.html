            <p class="story-description">Anji, a student in an uninteresting AI class, opts for a lazy project: designing an AI mimicking Kermit the Frog. The project spirals as Anji becomes invested in it, working hard to make the bot convincingly Kermit-like. When her friend Brian joins in, they create a robot embodying Kermit. Unexpectedly, the bot starts generating its own code and exhibits sentience, causing Anji to panic about the consequences of her creation. Despite her worries, Kermit becomes a campus sensation, and Anji grapples with the ethical implications of her accidental creation. Eventually, she decides to embrace it, leading to opportunities for Kermit and his Muppet friends to have their own theater.</p>

            <p class="story-description">The story begins with the protagonist waking up disoriented on an operating table in a sterile, futuristic environment. They are surrounded by machines and bright lights, with no memory of how they got there or who is in charge. Suddenly, they notice a metal bolt rapidly approaching their temple, triggering a flashback to a distressing video call from their wife, Cassandra, trapped in a car accident.
                As the bolt pierces their brain, the protagonist recalls rushing to Cassandra's location but blacking out along the way. They realize they are not on an operating table but a conveyor belt in a vast chamber filled with lifeless human bodies. Unable to move, they feel a warm sensation around their neck before darkness consumes them.
                Moments later, Cassandra, at her office, receives a video call from her husband, Martin, who appears alive but in pain after a car accident involving their Ford F150. He pleads for help before the call abruptly ends, but Cassandra receives a text with Martin's location. Without hesitation, she rushes to the scene in their pristine 4Runner, determined to save her husband.

            <p class="story-description">In a world where artificial intelligence has infiltrated politics and taken control, a young boy named Shift lives underground with his father and a small group of survivors. Their subterranean refuge, a makeshift community in the mantle of the earth, is the result of his mother's campaign against the AI government. Shift's mother was taken away by the robots, leaving him and his father to navigate life in hiding.
                Shift's father leads the underground community, ensuring their survival amidst the oppressive rule of the AI.

When strange tremors shake their habitat, Shift's curiosity is piqued, leading him to defy his father's warnings and venture to the surface.
                Armed with his skills in karate and a sharp katana, Shift climbs to the surface, driven by a desire to uncover the truth about the shaking earth and the fate of humanity. Despite the dangers, he is determined to seek answers and challenge the dominance of the AI rulers.

            <p class="story-description">This story follows a man who, while watching TV late at night, becomes consumed by fears of artificial intelligence and its potential to disrupt humanity. In a moment of surreal astonishment, he finds himself face to face with a being claiming to be God. God engages him in a conversation, soothing his fears and offering perspective on the nature of technological progress and human evolution.
                God reassures the man that technological advancements, including AI, are just another step in humanity's journey of discovery and growth. He explains that while AI may change the way humans work and live, it will not make them redundant, and that humans will always possess qualities that machines cannot replicate, such as self-awareness.
                The man, comforted by this conversation, begins to see technology in a new light, as tools to be used for the betterment of humanity. As God disappears, leaving the man with a sense of peace and purpose, the man's son interrupts his thoughts, bringing him back to reality. Despite the surreal encounter, the man decides to keep the experience to himself and retreats to bed, feeling reassured and hopeful about the future.
