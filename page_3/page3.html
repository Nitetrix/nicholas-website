My eyes open wearily to a blaring metallic abyss flooded with blinding bright lights.<br>

My head is pounding and I’m on an operating table.<br>

Who’s operating table is this?<br>

I’m surrounded by machines. Everything is so clean, so sleek.<br>

Where am I? How did I get here? And who the hell is in charge around here?<br>

A whirring sound brings me back to the present. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see it.<br>

A long iron bolt, housed within a metal alloy arm, is swiftly whizzing toward my temple. Anywhere else, it would look alien and unnatural. Here in this sterile cavern of chrome, however, I realize that it’s my human body that is the alien, the stranger.<br>

Before the bolt pierces my brain, a flash of memory pierces first. In an instant, it all comes rushing back to me:<br>

I was sitting at home and received a video call from my wife, Cassandra.<br>

On the screen, I saw her and my stomach dropped.<br>

She was inside our mangled Toyota 4Runner, screaming in agony, and panicking.<br>

She wailed “Martin!”, pleaded for my help, and then whispered, “I’ll always love you”.<br>

The call ended.<br>

My terror was immediately quelled by a glimmer of hope; she managed to text me her location.<br>

With our other car, a Ford F150, I desperately sped to the location.<br>

When the road ended, I got out and began running.<br>

Then, in an instant, everything went black.<br>

The next thing I know, I’m waking up here.<br>


The bolt pierces through my temple and into my brain, then retracts smoothly and mechanically.<br>

Not dead, but I can’t move.<br>

But my body is moving.<br>

Actually, it’s the table I am on that is moving.<br>

Now I see that it is not an operating table at all…it’s a conveyor belt.<br>

Horrified, I begin to focus in the distance and see miles and miles of metal: A never-ending catacomb of conveyor belts transporting lifeless, human bodies.<br>

I’m numb and very dazed, but can feel the belt has stopped moving for a moment.<br>

A warm sensation expands around my neck. My world fades to darkness.<br>


Moments later, while at her office, Cassandra receives a video call.<br>

Terrified, she sees that it’s her husband Martin…alive but in pain.<br>

He’s been in a car accident. The F150 looks like a crumpled mess.<br>

He strains in agony, “Help me, Cassandra. Please!”<br>

The phone disconnects.<br>

But, just then, she receives a text.<br>

It’s Martin sharing his location.<br>

Without a second thought, she frantically races in their pristine 4Runner to the location.<br>

The road ends, so Cassandra gets out and runs ahead to save her husband.<br>
